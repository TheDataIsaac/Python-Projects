This project analyzes the UK Road Safety data for the year 2015. The data contains information about road accidents and the vehicles involved in those accidents.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to use Pandas to preprocess and PostgreSQL to analyze the data. Additionally, the project uses visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide insights from the data.
